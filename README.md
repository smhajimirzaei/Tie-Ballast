# Tie-Ballast

This study develops an effective system for in-motion and autonomous identification of crossties and ballast, toward implementing non-contact sensors that can evaluate the condition of railroad structures. An array of sensors that include distance LIDAR sensors, magnetic sensors, and cameras are employed to test a prototype system in motion, onboard a remotely controlled track cart that can travel at speeds of up to 10 mph. The tests are performed on revenue-service tracks and the measurements are used to develop autonomous post-processing approaches that can be readily adopted by the railroads. Two distinct techniques for the LIDAR sensors are explored. Next, a machine learning model is developed to achieve the task with potentially more accuracy. To this end, three machine learning models, using three types of inputs, are developed to identify the optimal model. The DecisionTree algorithm coupled with the standard deviation of the difference between two distance sensors proved to be the most effective.
